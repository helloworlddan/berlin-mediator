Hi Daniel,

From 1 September you can book taxi trips in Munich for a fixed fare
 
This fixed fare is calculated based on the Munich taxi tariff and is guaranteed. This means: Regardless of whether there are delays during the journey (e.g., due to high traffic), you only pay the fixed fare shown before the booking.

Booking via the app is the same as before. The only change is that you will be shown the exact fixed fare before booking instead of a price range.

Once you have boarded the taxi, the driver will have to enter the fixed fare into the meter. Even if you are in a hurry, please be patient. It wonâ€™t take a minute.
